# AI Resume Analyzer Frontend

This is the React frontend for the AI Resume Analyzer.

## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Project Limitations
- This is NOT a real ATS system
- Results are AI-assisted simulations for educational purposes
- UI is simplified for demonstration

## Disclaimer
This tool provides simulated ATS analysis using AI. It is not intended for production use or real hiring decisions. Always verify results manually.

## AI-Assisted Decision Making
The backend uses AI to analyze resumes. The frontend displays the results but does not perform any AI processing.

## Future Improvements
- Add more detailed result visualizations
- Implement result export functionality
- Add accessibility improvements
